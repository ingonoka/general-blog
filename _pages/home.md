I worked 17 years for Visa, first in London, and then in Singapore and Dubai. In 2015, I switched careers and moved to AFPayments, Inc<sup>1</sup>. in Manila, Philippines. There I was CEO before I retired in 2021.

Even so I am retired, I still have an interest in AFCS and Payments systems, especially in Asia. I feel Asia is where the new and exiting developments in this industry are happening.

<sup>1</sup> AFPayments manages the automated fare collection system for the light rail mass transport in Manila (LRT1, LRT2 and MRT3).)
